# FCI - Collage Management System Project
#### System Abstraction
College Management system is an **Android** , iOS and web based application which is helpful for students as well as the colleges. In the existing system all the activities are done manually. It is very costly and time consuming. In our proposed system, students can view results, attendance percentage, internal marks, and download notes using phones. The data will be stored in the college server. The faculty can login into their college account through the web based app itself and update the academic result as well as notes every day and perform a variety of tasks required by them for efficient college management. In this system, students have easy access for viewing the marks, notes and send request to faculty for upload notes and they are not permitted to change/update the marks
